// long to inline, span several fields, or depend on when the request
// arrives. Each is a check, `(payload, details) => details`: it's given the
// errors found so far, in the hapi-validator detail shape, and returns the
// errors to report, so it can add its own or replace one the schema raised.
//
// withPayloadChecks wraps a route's payload validator so the checks run in
// order after the schema, whether or not it passed, and everything is
// reported together in one 400 rather than only once the rest is valid.
